## Introduction
Learning representations for multimedia content is critical for multimedia recommendation. go beyond the supervised learning paradigm, and incorporate the idea of self-supervised learning (SSL) into multimedia recommendation.

## Environment Requirement
The code has been tested running under Python 3.5.2. The required packages are as follows:
- Pytorch == 1.1.0
- torch-cluster == 1.4.2
- torch-geometric == 1.2.1
- torch-scatter == 1.2.0
- torch-sparse == 0.4.0
- numpy == 1.16.0

## Dataset
We provide three processed datasets: Kwai, Tiktok, and Movielnes.  
- You can find the full version of recommendation datasets via [Kwai](https://www.kuaishou.com/activity/uimc), [Tiktok](http://ai-lab-challenge.bytedance.com/tce/vc/), and [Movielens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
Since the copyright of datasets, we cannot release them directly. 
Anyone needs the full datasets, please contact the owner of datasets.
